QuestItem/QI03_CAPTION -> Replace : Mark of the Second Refuge

QuestItem/QI04_CAPTION -> Replace : Mark of the Third Refuge
QuestItem/QI04_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Sign of protection that prevented the suffering of its bearer. The Grievous Lady was wrapped in crimson mantles, a symbol of her link to the flesh of her wards.

QuestItem/QI06_LORE -> Replace : "Who was Tentudía, you ask? Well, she was once a girl born in this same yellowish village of Albero, like you and me. On her fifteenth year, something extremely unusual happened. Her parents watched as part of her hair began twisting, unavoidably turning into very thin thorns. Concerned with the thought that it might be a punishment from the Miracle, they locked her in as a novice inside a distant nunnery, famous for its strict cloistering, thus preventing the discovery of what would have, undoubtedly, been considered heresy."

The nuns, upon realising, were frightened by it and soon began considering her cursed, and a heretic, just as the parents of the girl had feared would happen."
QuestItem/QI08_CAPTION -> Replace : Tentudía's Skeletal Remains
QuestItem/QI08_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Remains of the novice Tentudía that were isolated from the rest so she could not receive a holy burial.
QuestItem/QI08_LORE -> Replace : "The nuns planned her execution in utmost secrecy, even without a trial or a report to the church, in fear it would reach the ears of the implacable inquisitors of the Miracle. So, after her condemnation, they did not give her the proper burial worthy of the sisters of the nunnery, but instead buried the remains of her body scattered around the vicinity, because it is known that if one's body is not whole in the burial, the soul will not cross through the Dream."

QuestItem/QI201_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : An eyeball of solid gold that adorned the scythe of Isidora, the singer of the dead. Condemned to an eternity of deep-rooted darkness, the melted face of the Traitor was also robbed of his eyes for he had seen too much. The lady of the ossuary was charged to watch over him, and the bones that used to sing with her found a new tomb in the darkest of corners.
QuestItem/QI201_LORE -> Replace : The children opened the doors of their houses and ran out after her shouting, “Isidora! Sing to us, Isidora!” But, still dressed in one of her flamboyant stage outfits, Isidora did not sing to them that night.@Instead she headed towards the cemetery and stopped before the entrance to the crypt that connects to the ossuary beneath the old Church of Albero. The intrigued children fell silent behind the iron gates. And it was then that she began to intone verses that no one had ever heard before. After a short while, another distant voice could be heard, accompanying the sad melody from the depths of the crypt, forming a beautiful yet mournful duet. The lady then walked through the stone archway, closing the door behind her. As her voice faded into the distance, more and more voices joined with her, as if a great choir of dozens was awaiting her at the bottom of the steps. When the song came to an end and they heard the final strains rise up from beneath the ground, the children walked away with tears in their eyes, and the cemetery recovered its usual silence.@Never again was the singing lady seen, and ever since she has been remembered as Isidora, the Lady of the Ossuary and the voice of the dead.

QuestItem/QI202_LORE -> Replace : “A curse on you. A curse on your shadow beneath the dark waters that writhes around knotted in strange hieroglyphics.

He walked down long hallways, crammed with dusty tomes, past bookcases filled with ramshackle wooden shelves that had long ago rotted in the humid air, when suddenly he heard a grinding sound the key of knotted wood was stirring in the palm of his hand and seemed to be twisting more and more.

Many years of drought razed the land back then, but although the other crops dried up and died, the olive trees on our hill would not they remained the best harvests, to everyone's surprise.

QuestItem/QI72_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Key for the transportation that leads to the remote convent.
QuestItem/QI72_LORE -> Replace : The key must be silver, but not any kind. I want it to be the purest there is. Bring it to me when its beauty is as high as its task is meaningful. The chariot will be sealed and forbidden, and your horses will sleep for as long as I order it. This I command, and my command is the command of His Holiness Himself.
QuestItem/QI75_CAPTION -> Replace : Chalice of Inverted Verses

QuestItem/QI79_CAPTION -> Replace : Crimson Briar
QuestItem/QI79_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Small gift from Deogracias, nailed into the effigy of the Twisted under the guard of your sword. The thorns arisen from the Miracle feed on sin and guilt, growing with the burden that its bearer carries.

I have written about our church, our saints and our Miracle of the Greatest Pain. I must inform you that I have made the decision to leave, although I intend to continue writing.

Relic/RE01_CAPTION -> Replace : Blood Perpetuated in Sand
Relic/RE01_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Preserved blood with miraculous properties. With the passage of its bearer, new ledges are revealed, formerly invisible to the beholder's eyes.@The Miracle is truly unfathomable, and no one knows the origin of the blood that swirls around the wearer's feet.
Relic/RE01_LORE -> Replace : "Take this bag and fill it with sand. Now imbue it with the blood spilling from these dreadful wounds, so it will turn crimson red. With it you will show the way through these dry lands to those who are yet to follow. Leave me, now. I want to say my prayers, for I will soon be joining the dry sap of these roots that painfully embrace Our Father..."
Relic/RE02_CAPTION -> Replace : Incorrupt Hand of the Fraternal Master
Relic/RE02_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Sacred relic, in a perfect state of conservation. The hand shakes gently when it considers it necessary, secretly articulated by ethereal muscles and tendons. The bell that it's holding warns the wearer of the nearby presence of a mystery. @After all, no bastion is safe from the tenacity of the truly curious.
Relic/RE02_LORE -> Replace : "... As soon as the atrocious earth tremor was heard, they knew something dreadful had happened. They searched for their master in the deepest parts of the cave, where they were met with a gigantic dust cloud that extended far beyond their eyes, and even though they called the name of their master, there were no answers. Days went by until the cloud cleared and they could face the devastating consequences of the landslide, feeling hopeless, but suddenly, amidst their tears, they heard a faraway sound."
Relic/RE03_CAPTION -> Replace : Nail Uprooted from Dirt
Relic/RE03_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Incorrupt remains of the Great Pilgrim, founder of the order and comfort to his followers. His feet never stopped, always taking him forward in his mysterious wandering through Cvstodia.

Relic/RE03_LORE -> Replace : "... And that fingernail was the one that Martyr Nicanor ripped from himself when he was buried alive between spasms of pain after a cruel torture in front of his followers who cried in silence. The fingernail barely visible among the removed dirt was picked up by the last follower, who was lamenting such a horrid event when all the others left and whose name is unknown. He wrapped it using a piece of cloth torn from his own clothes, and that same night, he went to the church whose congregation was the same one that had denounced Nicanor as a heretic, hid the fingernail among its inner bricks, and left..."
Relic/RE04_CAPTION -> Replace : Shroud of Dreamt Sins
Relic/RE04_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Yellowish fabric, witness to febrile confessions. It still quivers in the face of tortured souls, allowing one to listen to those who can no longer speak.
Relic/RE04_LORE -> Replace : Febrile as he was, he hardly noticed someone had sat down next to him. A gentle hand patted a white cloth on his forehead; it was a fabric of the utmost softness, which allowed light through it as if it were a sheet of paper, and was soaking his feverish sweat and providing such relief that he couldn't help but fall asleep. When the cloth was soaked, the nun got up and handed it to the Mother Superior, adding "With this, we'll be able to have his confession."
Relic/RE05_CAPTION -> Replace : Linen of Golden Thread
Relic/RE05_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Product of a spinning wheel that only turned on full moon nights, this thin thread was plaited to immortalise its progeny. Bestowed as a gift by the first-born, it allows The Penitent One to descend into bottomless abysses. 
Relic/RE05_LORE -> Replace : Members of The Mother came and took the painting away as soon as I told them it was finished. They didn't say a word, they just covered it up and carried it away. I have been painting for The Mother all my life, recreating moments of the lives of the saints, but for this last canvas... it was as if they didn't want anyone laying eyes on it; they did not even let me, its creator, see it on display, if they ever came to display it. It was the last commission they requested from me.
Relic/RE07_CAPTION -> Replace : Silvered Lung of Dolphos
Relic/RE07_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Organ preserved in sparkling silver, with plenty of filigrees. Cardinal Dolphos melted his spoons in a pot, looking to escape jealousies with the argentine concoction. Protects the wearer from poisonous Miasma.
Relic/RE07_LORE -> Replace : Confessions from Dolphos. Part 3@@What's the use of gowns. What good is the gold from rings. Only the purity of silver that once was embellished possesses the graces of Miracle.

Relic/RE10_CAPTION -> Replace : Three Gnarled Tongues
Relic/RE10_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Tied together by a broken oath, these tongues speak words that only the foundations of Cvstodia can hear. Their pleas awaken the sleeping roots from their lethargy, creating footbridges and climbable ledges for their wearers.
Relic/RE10_LORE -> Replace : These are the three tongues born from the monstrosity. Three tongues that are three voices. Three cries in harmony. The tongues are knotted into one. Roots grow and twist in their presence, just like the hair of what were once three sisters.
RosaryBead/RB01_CAPTION -> Replace : Dove Skull
RosaryBead/RB01_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Skull of a bird, drilled as a collet. Its apparent frailness slightly strengthens The Penitent One's defences.

RosaryBead/RB02_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Ember crystallised through a long forgotten ritual. It retains some of the heat of a bonfire lit on a different land. Tempers the heart, increasing the defences of whoever carries it.
RosaryBead/RB02_LORE -> Replace : And so the March was sung, as a small group of parishioners walked in procession to the graveyard. The prayer was repeated over and over again along the way, turning their voices into a hypnotic whisper, murmurous and unrhythmic. Upon arrival at the burial ground, everything fell silent. When, with each shovelful from the undertakers,  the soil dropped cold onto the coffin, a hooded girl, rumoured to be the daughter of the deceased, threw in a hot ember that gleamed on its way down into the pit. The dirt continued to cover the hole but, to everyone's astonishment, the ember could still be seen, glowing under the frosty soil.
RosaryBead/RB03_CAPTION -> Replace : Silver Grape
RosaryBead/RB03_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : A dead fruit converted into a bead, in a display of clerical vanity. Its cold hardness passes onto its wearer, enhancing their defences considerably.
RosaryBead/RB03_LORE -> Replace : Confessions from Dolphos. Part 2@@I must melt more beads, as many beads as I can. I need their silver, I need their embellished floral curves. The virtue of silver will adorn my lungs inside and out, and when I breathe, the pure grace of Miracle will penetrate. It will embellish my stomach inside and out, and when I eat, I will be nourished with the pure grace of the Miracle. It will ornament my eyes inside and out, and when I look, I will see the Miracle itself.
RosaryBead/RB04_CAPTION -> Replace : Uvula of Proclamation
RosaryBead/RB04_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : When the Uvula is equipped, you have a chance of earning Tears of Atonement when destroying an object.
RosaryBead/RB04_LORE -> Replace : Decree from His Holiness Escribar@@"It shall be called the Anointed Legion" said His Holiness.

RosaryBead/RB05_CAPTION -> Replace : Hollow Pearl
RosaryBead/RB05_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Empty, tarnished sphere. There is no trace of nacre left, but it retains just a hint of bluish sheen. It creates fervour when destroying surrounding objects.
RosaryBead/RB05_LORE -> Replace : "It has got to him, brother, the Miracle is within these walls," said the friar, scared.@"Grab that piece of wood and help me block his cell," answered the other friar, younger than him.@And, while they both parted slowly, listening to the screams and banging through the massive wooden door, a small, round object rolled from under it.
RosaryBead/RB06_CAPTION -> Replace : Knot of Hair
RosaryBead/RB06_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Tangle of hair knotted with the strength of three broken bonds. A strong knot allows it to be used as a rosary bead, carrying part of its unyielding strength to the wearer.
RosaryBead/RB06_LORE -> Replace : No. 4 All those who had come to the sacred link knelt in the presence of that fruit of the Miracle, thus making it an object of worship from that moment on. We built an altar worthy of such holiness and placed it there. Shortly afterwards, during one bleak night, the priests who slept inside the church heard a loud groan, a cry made of three voices, yet one voice at the same time. When we got there, the egg was gone. Ever since then, I have been looking for it, visiting all the places I could and talking to every soul I could.
RosaryBead/RB07_CAPTION -> Replace : Painted Wood Bead
RosaryBead/RB07_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Sphere covered in yellow varnish. The chipped paint betrays its origin holm oak of the Forest of the Holy Line. It recovers health when destroying surrounding objects.
RosaryBead/RB07_LORE -> Replace : We call this pilgrimage route The Trail. Our wagons have always passed through here, and the tracks have gotten deep enough to even unearth the chalky sand that lay hidden under the thick forest, such that if one could see it from above, it would look like a long ochre line crossing the woods.
RosaryBead/RB08_CAPTION -> Replace : Piece of a Golden Mask
RosaryBead/RB08_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Piece of embossed gold, part of a mask broken years ago. The nuns of the Convent of the Charred Visage swear never to let the world see their burned faces, and the conviction of its old wearer has permeated the metal. Grants some protection against flames.
RosaryBead/RB08_LORE -> Replace : No. 2 The years passed and she started showing natural signs of ageing, just like her companions, except for the burn, which remained as fresh as the moment the boiling oil had spilled. The wound was still smoking, scorching and reeking. This was understood to be a miracle, and she was canonised in life by the Church; she became known as Our Lady of the Charred Visage. An order was founded in her name, where all the existing nuns as well as those who wanted to take up the habit had to burn their faces in the same way as Áurea had. She wears a golden mask under which she hides the gauze that alleviates the eternal pain that the burns still inflict on her.
RosaryBead/RB09_CAPTION -> Replace : Moss Preserved in Glass
RosaryBead/RB09_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Minute jar filled with moss. The tiny white flowers that shimmer inside can grant some protection against toxins.
RosaryBead/RB09_LORE -> Replace : The ashen grey air lashed us. We could hardly breathe, and remained locked up in the parish, placing damp cloths on the doors and windows. We were suffocating. Then, one fateful night, there was a knock on the door, and I could see a woman who, without a word, had placed on the floor a cloth with patches of pearly moss on it. I stared at her in disbelief, as she appeared to have smeared the moss on her nostrils. Then, turning around, the woman left. Hopeful, I recounted what I had witnessed to the brothers, and we decided to spread the substance on our noses as she had done. It wasn't long before we were able to breathe normally, and we waited without fear until the ashy, leaden sky would regain its blue colour.
RosaryBead/RB101_CAPTION -> Replace : Reliquary of the Fervent Heart
RosaryBead/RB101_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : It retains in its bosom the mark of a fulfilled penance. It inflames the heart of its bearer with burning faith, granting automatic regeneration of Fervour.
RosaryBead/RB101_LORE -> Replace : To obtain forgiveness for the sin committed, the repentant must cover his face with the iron mask, because sin may have no identity, no owner, no voice.

RosaryBead/RB102_CAPTION -> Replace : Reliquary of the Suffering Heart

Only this pain of repentance is capable of eliciting the purifying grace that reconciles the sinner to the Father. Only sincere sorrow paves the way.
RosaryBead/RB103_CAPTION -> Replace : Reliquary of the Sorrowful Heart
RosaryBead/RB103_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : It retains in its bosom the mark of a fulfilled penance. It burdens the heart of its bearer with True Guilt, turning the Bile Flasks into receptacles of pure liquid Fervour.
RosaryBead/RB103_LORE -> Replace : To obtain forgiveness for the sin committed, the repentant must choose his penance and carry it along the Path of Blame until the final reconciliation with the Father. Each Path of Blame is unique and belongs only to the penitent who chooses and follows it. It will remain marked in his memory as scars on his own body, in the face of a great wound. Only in this way will he obtain victory over sin.
RosaryBead/RB104_CAPTION -> Replace : Token of Appreciation
RosaryBead/RB104_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Just an ordinary marble, presented as thanks for the charity received. Somehow, the scratched glass resonates with the empty Bile Flasks, increasing your strength when their liquid has run out.
RosaryBead/RB104_LORE -> Replace : Finally, the church is going to open after so long. Soon, the constant silence of this place will end. A new light will enter through the gate and the dust will rise from the worn tiles and damp wood of the pews. Everything must be perfect. Everything in place and ready. I am the child of the mass. This is my calling.
RosaryBead/RB105_CAPTION -> Replace : Cloistered Ruby
RosaryBead/RB105_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : A crystal sphere imprisoning a ruby heart. The gem sparkles with lightning from other lands, filling the glass with a stormy light. The strange energy fills the wearer with determination, electrifying the very air around him after drinking from the Bile Flask.

If you keep something very precious so it cannot be seen or coveted by other eyes, reserving it only for the Father, that treasure will receive the greatest of blessings. We will cover up the sheen of this stone and make sure that no one knows of its existence.
RosaryBead/RB106_CAPTION -> Replace : Bead of Gold Thread
RosaryBead/RB106_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : A ball made of liquid gold, spun into fine fibres. Viscous to the touch, these miraculous strands are avidly coveted by alchemists and scholars. The passion woven into each filament seeps into the sacred Bile Flasks, accelerating their use.
RosaryBead/RB106_LORE -> Replace : A miracle occurred in front of me. I found her lying on the floor. Her face was pale, as if dead, yet relaxed and at peace. Next to her, lay the bodies of four women covered in gold that shone and illuminated the room as if lit by an internal fire. From where I stood, I could hear the beating of those five hearts; they echoed in the room, slowly sounding in unison. @@There were golden threads at my feet, all over the room; they seemed to be attached to those golden bodies. I took up part of that thread and made a ball. That would be the proof for the others to believe me.
RosaryBead/RB107_CAPTION -> Replace : Cloistered Sapphire
RosaryBead/RB107_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : A crystal sphere imprisoning a sapphire heart. The gem sparkles with lightning from other lands, filling the glass with a stormy light. The strange energy fills the wearer with determination, electrifying the very air around him after he performs an Execution.
RosaryBead/RB107_LORE -> Replace : All those who have wanted to isolate themselves, all those who have freely locked themselves away as a chosen way of life, will have the blessing of the Miracle. No one can serve two masters either you serve the Miracle, or you serve the world. When you are in this cloister, remember these words, sister.
RosaryBead/RB108_CAPTION -> Replace : Fire Enclosed in Enamel
RosaryBead/RB108_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : A glossy medal, which holds a wild fire of the purest of whites. Jewels like this used to be hung from the mainmast, to capture the bright lights that appear on the high seas. It aids the connection with the Miracle, accelerating the use of the Prayers.
RosaryBead/RB108_LORE -> Replace : A livid fire arose from the top of the mast, a tongue of fire sometimes white, sometimes blue, dancing wildly and seeming not to diminish at all despite the terrible storm that fell upon us. It was the touch of the Father's finger, pointing down from on high to our boat. The furious light opened up a path through the night and guided us through the storm.
RosaryBead/RB10_CAPTION -> Replace : Frozen Olive
RosaryBead/RB10_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Summer fruit trapped in an endless winter. Born from an olive tree turned into a prison, its frosted oils bolster the wearer's defences when their strength is nearly exhausted.
RosaryBead/RB10_LORE -> Replace : As Gemino traversed the path of the Frozen Olive Trees with the rest of the damned, towards the terrible hollow metal statues where those that awaited would die abandoned, he stepped barefoot on a fallen olive that had not yet disappeared under the snow. Without drawing attention, he picked it up and squeezed it in his hands, knowing it would be the last thing he'd treasure.
RosaryBead/RB11_CAPTION -> Replace : Quirce's Scorched Bead
RosaryBead/RB11_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Small sphere carved on the remains of an unjustly lit bonfire. It burns with the soft embers of those flames, which could not touch Quirce's skin. Imbued with his power, it gives great protection against fire.
RosaryBead/RB11_LORE -> Replace : Legend of Quirce. @@The horrifying flames consumed Quirce's body as he cried out in unbearable pain. But these were not ordinary flames they were the flames of the Miracle. The flames burned him to ashes and, before the eyes of the inquisitors, the flames brought him back, time after time, in unparalleled torture. Burning and burning again. Screaming and screaming again. Quirce, the son of the bonfires, knew what his penance was going to be.
RosaryBead/RB12_CAPTION -> Replace : Wicker Knot
RosaryBead/RB12_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Bead braided in a spiral motion, covered with a light coat of varnish that has protected it from the wear and tear of the years. A mother's hands worked these strands and blessed them. Their influence provides protection from toxic damage.
RosaryBead/RB12_LORE -> Replace : When she was to be taken to the campfire, the inquisitors took the baby from her arms, and she screamed, begging for the child to not see her burn. The boy, who stared at her from afar, drenched in tears, was blindfolded the blindfold was immediately moistened. The bonfire was surrounded by people, there to see the execution. They screamed, calling her a witch and heretic. When the flames started licking the pile of firewood, she asked a kind soul to build a wicker figure in her image and size, and to place the child in its arms so the baby would not miss her. And so they did, and when the figure was built, they placed the bawling child in its arms, and the orphan immediately stopped crying. The Miracle was merciful once again. 
RosaryBead/RB13_CAPTION -> Replace : Perpetva's Protection
RosaryBead/RB13_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Ribbon of crimson cloth, carefully rolled and still scented with ancient oils. Members of The Anointed Legion wrapped their bodies in these soft ribbons anointed with protective oils, which contrasted with their otherwise heavy armour. The determination of its former wearer offers protection against lightning attacks. 
RosaryBead/RB13_LORE -> Replace : "Esdras, you say?" spoke the soldier, "That madman could not bear the death of his sister. He's still talking to her as if she were there beside him. Sometimes it even seems as if they were arguing. He's long gone and hasn't been seen since".
RosaryBead/RB14_CAPTION -> Replace : Thorned Symbol
RosaryBead/RB14_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Thorns braided with enormous patience by calloused hands, creating a protective symbol. Only unwavering conviction could prompt the creation of an item like this, and these feelings permeate its prickly surface. It protects its wearer from damage through contact.
RosaryBead/RB14_LORE -> Replace : I'm still inside the creature. I can hear its roar outside, I can hear the thunderous beating of its heart. I just wanted to sleep, but I saw the Miracle in my dreams. It spoke to me. That is why I lie down in the Lady's open arms. But the Miracle appeared to me again. It was more and more tangible. Then I woke up, but I was no longer myself. I was a prisoner trapped inside a rooted body. A body immersed in constant anger. In constant pain. I am awake in a sleeping body.
RosaryBead/RB15_CAPTION -> Replace : Piece of a Tombstone
RosaryBead/RB15_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Piece of a ceramic slab, strangely found on the snowy peaks. Those from the village rarely left their arid lands to face the cold of the mountains, but this tombstone had undoubtedly belonged to someone from Albero. The fragment confers resistance to falls, eliminating recovery time. 
RosaryBead/RB15_LORE -> Replace : It is said that the Albero graveyard is even older than Albero itself. It was built even before the church was erected. It was a graveyard isolated from everything in this arid, ochre land, considered unholy. The church did not take long to find out about this, and dug all the tombs up, scattering the remains across the fields. That's when the brotherhood of the Genuine Sepulchre was founded, in charge of collecting the remains of the dead and giving them a second burial. I have kept this piece of clay tombstone since then.
RosaryBead/RB16_CAPTION -> Replace : Sphere of the Sacred Smoke
RosaryBead/RB16_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Small, translucent pearl, with a closing mechanism that's almost impossible to see. They were traditionally filled with the vapours coming from the big incense burners, in the Mother of Mothers. This bead, however, contains something different. Its miraculous influence fills the bile flasks after some attacks, but the Miracle is capricious, and this does not happen often. 
RosaryBead/RB16_LORE -> Replace : "...Once everyone had left, she approached the bonfire, still smoking with the scorched remains of the heretic. With a swift gesture of her fingers, she triggered the imperceptible lock that would open the tiny jewelled pearl in two and, passing it through the grey smoke, she closed it again, trusting that it would preserve that smoke forever..."
RosaryBead/RB17_CAPTION -> Replace : Small Bead of Red Wax
RosaryBead/RB17_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Tiny pebble of melted wax, of a muted crimson. Prayers muttered in its presence slightly strengthen the vitality of the wearer.
RosaryBead/RB17_LORE -> Replace : The abbey ceased to be a quiet place. Cries of pain coming from every cell pierced the walls. The old friar knew he would be next, so he got up from his cot, where he had been huddled, and glanced at the few items that lay on his table, most of them mementos from his life before joining the Order. He wanted to be kissed by the Miracle while immersed in those gentle thoughts. Triggering most memories were some small balls of wax, now covered in dust, that he used to enlarge by picking up wax from the candles during processions.
RosaryBead/RB18_CAPTION -> Replace : Medium Bead of Red Wax
RosaryBead/RB18_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Sphere of accumulated crimson wax. Echoes of ancient prayers resound in its core, and moderately reinforce the vitality of the wearer.

RosaryBead/RB201_CAPTION -> Replace : Light of the Lady of the Lamp
RosaryBead/RB201_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : An iron amulet, forged in the shape of a lantern and rusted by humidity and saltpetre. Sailors wore it so the Lady of the Lamp might find them if they fell overboard. It is still impregnated with the feverish prayers of its last owner, increasing all defences when flasks run empty. @It was of little use to the poor ruffian, for all defence is useless against the mighty seas, and the Lady of the Lamp pays no heed to superstitions.
RosaryBead/RB201_LORE -> Replace : “Only a dozen of us survived the storm. In the night, the waters were black and freezing and remained still. We tried to swim to keep ourselves warm and, with a bit of luck, find some driftwood to cling onto and rest. We tried to find one another, but our cries were muffled in strange echoes, making it impossible to work out where they were coming from. When the cries began to die out we realised that the frozen darkness would be our grave. But in that moment, from out of the shadowy mists, a white light appeared, a light that was heading our way. Then, one by one, a young man with a lantern on his boat, pulled us from our watery fate. Once he had got us back to dry land, he went on his way without a word. Although we never knew his name, one thing’s for sure, we shall never forget him.@And strike me dead if all that I say is not the truth!”
RosaryBead/RB202_CAPTION -> Replace : Scale of Burnished Alabaster
RosaryBead/RB202_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : A fragment of a real scale and hard as stone. Its whiteness is so pure that it glows brightly under the palest of lights, especially when danger approaches the one who wears it. Its lunar light allows the Penitent One to block attacks from behind.
RosaryBead/RB202_LORE -> Replace : “Captain,@We have been in this black fog for what we now believe to be five days. Nothing moves, nothing lives, nothing breathes here. All is echoes and shadows. Not even the boat creaks or sways on these oily black waters. And nor is there any sign of the Serpent.@We feel as if we are slowly sinking, for the reflection of our tired and emaciated faces on the water’s surface seems, with each passing moment, to be ever closer. This will no doubt be our grave, there is no way back. @We pray that this message in a bottle reaches you. It has been an honour to serve under you.@May the sea have mercy on us.”
RosaryBead/RB203_CAPTION -> Replace : The Young Mason’s Wheel
RosaryBead/RB203_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : The remains of a miniature wooden cart, worn by an apprentice who was separated from his master in a terrible accident.

This amulet is now imbued with the poor lad’s longing for release, increasing the speed of movement of whoever wears it.
RosaryBead/RB203_LORE -> Replace : “Father, the walls do not move. @The library does not wish its wisdom to escape these enclosures. Its corridors deceive and confine all those who enter in search of its forbidden tomes and ancient secrets. Its wardens, the silent monks who wander between its shelves, know this and are themselves captives of its power. Here, we shall remain forever with a thirst for knowledge never to be sated. I hope one day you will read these words and not blame yourself for my death. The penned word wanted it so.”
RosaryBead/RB204_CAPTION -> Replace : Crown of Gnawed Iron
RosaryBead/RB204_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : An engagement ring forged in iron and blackened from the many times it was cast into the flames.

RosaryBead/RB204_LORE -> Replace : “At times when I pray within these sacred walls of peace, I sense the presence of the Lady of the Bandaged Sword. At times, I hear her breathing behind her golden helmet that blinkers her eyes, as she waits in silence, cloaked in darkness. At times, I hear her murmuring what sound like never-ending prayers. And yet, I have never seen her enter nor leave this place. What or who can she be waiting for?”
RosaryBead/RB20_CAPTION -> Replace : Little Toe made of Limestone

RosaryBead/RB22_LORE -> Replace : Finally he said "A genuine genuflecting pilgrim will always walk alone. It is the solitary path that will grant him constant meditation and understanding of what it means to be a pilgrim in the land of the Miracle. For that is our rule." Then he got up, and looked at all of us for a long time while we remained silent. Then he left, and we never saw him again.

The old friar knew he would be next, so he got up from his cot, where he had been huddled, and glanced at the few items that lay on his table, most of them mementos from his life before joining the Order. He wanted to be kissed by the Miracle while immersed in those gentle thoughts. Triggering most memories were some small balls of wax, now covered in dust, that he used to enlarge by picking up wax from the candles during processions."
RosaryBead/RB25_CAPTION -> Replace : Medium Bead of Blue Wax

For when it pours upon this land of the dead, it shall be blessed in the eyes of the Miracle, and those who rest here shall live on the other side of the Dream, on the Way of Eternal Processions. Let it bleed.
RosaryBead/RB301_CAPTION -> Replace : Crimson Heart of a Miura
RosaryBead/RB301_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : A strange artifact, said to be found within the corpse of the fiercest of bulls.

RosaryBead/RB30_CAPTION -> Replace : Drop of Coagulated Ink
RosaryBead/RB30_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Each hesitation of the scribe was a new stain on his scriptorium. Words not written, censored before they were born onto the paper, were powerful, too. This cluster of ink grazed by the Affliction increases the power of Prayers.

RosaryBead/RB31_CAPTION -> Replace : Amber Eye
RosaryBead/RB31_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Bead carefully carved in the shape of an eyeball that appears to glint in the dark. A sacred tree was struck by lightning, but did not suffer any damage. Its resin did not allow the lightning to escape, so it still remains in the amber nucleus, providing great protection against electrical attacks. 
RosaryBead/RB31_LORE -> Replace : This was the first frozen tree, the first for which we all kneeled to pray, the first in which one could see a face, pious and sorrowful, among the deformities of the pale, frozen trunk. One day it wept from the concavities that shaped his eyes. He wept sap, so golden, so brilliant... The Amber Eye...
RosaryBead/RB32_CAPTION -> Replace : Muted Bell

Something lustrous that he held in his cold stone hands caught his attention a shapeless fruit, the size of an apple, with a silvery glow and a delicious appearance. Hungry as he was, he took it, but when he tried to bite it he had to hold back a yelp of pain, for the fruit turned out to be made of metal. Confused, he grabbed a nearby stone and smashed the fruit with all his might, managing to make a small crack in it, from which a dense reddish liquid poured. Without thinking it twice, he drank the liquid, which tasted salty like blood.
RosaryBead/RB33_CAPTION -> Replace : Consecrated Amethyst
RosaryBead/RB33_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : A gem that gives off an intense aroma of incense.

RosaryBead/RB36_CAPTION -> Replace : Seashell of the Inverted Spiral

She recounted that the shell had its spiral inverted, and that this was why, when she held it close to her ear, she could hear the sound of the waves moving away. Her parents, faced with what seemed like a confession of insanity, and out of fear that there was something of witchcraft in that cursed object, took it away and threw it off the cliff. She, in spite of all her efforts, never managed to find that seashell.
RosaryBead/RB37_CAPTION -> Replace : Calcified Eye of Erudition
RosaryBead/RB37_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Eyeball belonging to Alavaroz the scribe, who glimpsed the truth hidden to so many other eyes. Its stony scrutiny reveals the vital essence of enemies.

As he was about to become a complete statue, in a final sigh his tears softened one of his eyes that he managed to separate himself from the rest of the body by falling to the ground. Then we discreetly moved her rigid body of lime from her cell to the lower parts of the archicatedral along with the other forbidden statues, we put a wide loom over her so that no one else would know that under her would sleep, punished by the miracle, the Great Scribe.

ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0208_0 -> Replace : It is of little use for me to remain here. Go with the Father, oh Penitent One.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0209_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, heed my confession... Cowardice taketh root inside of me in the face of this new test by the Grievous Miracle.

ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0211_2 -> Replace : And what about the torturing of the mind when guilt pierceth our hearts time after time?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0211_3 -> Replace : What more punishment do ye want, oh sins of mine?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0212_0 -> Replace : I halt here to look for a crossing to the other side, so as to continue my penance in wandering. Ah! Don't let it be a disturbance to thee, Penitent in guilt, for my feet will find their long-awaited walking.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0212_1 -> Replace : Penitent One, may thy trades silence neither thy spirit nor thy frame.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0213_0 -> Replace : Oh, sins of mine...
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0214_0 -> Replace : Thou art before the First Pilgrim. The first of the Barefoot Rule, Master of all errant sinners.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0214_1 -> Replace : This old limestone statue was erected where the pilgrimage of the master ended, where he took his last step.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0214_2 -> Replace : It was then that the Miracle carried him in its arms so he could continue his path on the road of the old processions.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0215_0 -> Replace : Barefoot Master, what else dost thou want from me?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0216_0 -> Replace : Barefoot Master, wait for me...
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0217_0 -> Replace : The Master showeth us the continuation of the path. New steps await us under the cold stone.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0218_0 -> Replace : Oh... Penitent One, we are surrounded by tragedy, death and pain...
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0218_1 -> Replace : The Miracle punishes us with its many terrible hands, hands that reach everywhere, into all hearts and even into our thoughts.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0218_2 -> Replace : Is there worse punishment than the one for which we do not know the reason?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0219_0 -> Replace : An insurmountable wall seemeth to interpose itself between our feet and our holy destinations.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0219_1 -> Replace : Will there ever be a blessing that saveth us from this sorrow?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0220_0 -> Replace : What can I do to avoid the difficulties that the Miracle layeth in front of my bare feet?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0301_0 -> Replace : Sorrowful be the Heart, Penitent One. Welcome to Albero, sanctuary to this humble brotherhood of the Kissers of Wounds.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0301_1 -> Replace : Few remain here who can still employ it, but Tirso is my name.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0301_2 -> Replace : There are few of us who still care for the sick and ailing.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0301_3 -> Replace : With devout kisses, we bless the wounds of those who seek our protection, thus both we and they remain at the mercy of the Miracle.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0302_0 -> Replace : Sorrowful be the Heart, Penitent One full of clemency.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0303_0 -> Replace : The Miracle is taking us away, one after the other. Could we avoid this fate that is imposed on us from the High Wills?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0304_0 -> Replace : The Virtuous Pain flogs us time after time. Oh! When will it be satisifed?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0305_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, where will we go, afflicted and devout, when the sun of life sets on us?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0306_0 -> Replace : That which you carry with you... You have embraced...punishment, Penitent One. Is it your desire for the Miracle to keep you in mind more than the rest of us?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0306_1 -> Replace : It is not my responsibility, but beware of the twisted paths where that communion will lead you.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0307_0 -> Replace : How many more trials must we overcome?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0308_0 -> Replace : We will soon be reunited with the Punishment and with the punished on the way of the Old Processions, on the other side of the Dream.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0309_0 -> Replace : The Miracle has been merciful to us.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0309_1 -> Replace : As long as this brotherhood has brothers, even if just one, there will be hope for the ill.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0309_2 -> Replace : Take this as a token of gratitude, Penitent One in piety.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0310_0 -> Replace : Merciful be, Penitent One. With your contribution, the work of this brotherhood carries on. 
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0311_0 -> Replace : Time outside these walls passes by strangely, in sundowns we need not contemplate.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0311_1 -> Replace : But if your penance happens to carry you under said skies, be so kind as to bring us some ingredients for our ointments.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0312_0 -> Replace : The will in the Miracle shall show you which ones they are.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0401_0 -> Replace : Thou hast called upon the Winch of the Order of the True Shrine.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0402_0 -> Replace : This poor lass...
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0402_1 -> Replace : Many tears were shed in her blessed name.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0402_2 -> Replace : A thousand prayers do not clarify whether or not the Grievous Miracle is a manifestation of true holiness...
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0402_3 -> Replace : Still, in our heart lieth no doubt that she was unjustly punished.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0403_0 -> Replace : The remnants of Tentudía have been gathered. It is now possible to give her the second, true burial.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0403_1 -> Replace : With this supplication she shall watch over thee.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0404_0 -> Replace : Then thou hast already met Cleofás...
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0404_1 -> Replace : He was once a member of this congregation. One woeful day he broke his vows, and left upon hearing the news that...a miracle had occurred.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0404_2 -> Replace : We never heard from him again.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0404_3 -> Replace : Please give him this. It will mean a lot to him.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0405_0 -> Replace : The Order blesses thee, Penitent One in silence.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0406_0 -> Replace : Find the next remnants. The Order blesses thee.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0407_0 -> Replace : In this place we gather the remains of those who were separated and forgotten, so we can grant them holy burial as our charitable Rule prescribeth.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0407_1 -> Replace : Helpest these poor souls, Oh Penintent one in silence. The Order blesses you.
ST04_LVDOVICO/MSG_0404_0 -> Replace : No answer.
ST05_DAGGER/DLG_0502_0 -> Replace : Take the next of my deep pains.
ST05_DAGGER/DLG_0503_0 -> Replace : Take the last one of these pains of mine, the deepest and sharpest of them all.
ST05_DAGGER/DLG_0503_1 -> Replace : Now depart towards the Cradle of Punishment, oh Penitent One in guilt.
ST05_DAGGER/MSG_0501_0 -> Replace : Maximum health has increased.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0601_0 -> Replace : From a place of blessings have I been entrusted with watching over you, Penitent One. Thus it has been arranged.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0601_1 -> Replace : My name is Viridiana. I have been granted a gift with which I can assist you in carrying your burden if required, but only you can make that choice. 
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0602_A_0 -> Replace : So be it.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0602_B_0 -> Replace : So be it.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0602_C_0 -> Replace : So be it.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0603_A_0 -> Replace : Here I shall remain, lest you change your mind.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0603_B_0 -> Replace : Here I shall remain, lest you change your mind.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0603_C_0 -> Replace : Here I shall remain, lest you change your mind.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0604_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, do not be troubled by me or my outward appearance, now changed and seasoned. This might be... a small price to pay for such joyous alliance.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0605_0 -> Replace : Pay no heed to the wrinkles of my skin, the hair that grows silvery or my trembling legs. Our pact has yet to be concluded, as has your arduous enterprise.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0606_0 -> Replace : I feel fortunate to partake in this victory.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0606_1 -> Replace : Before I depart, I want these words to accompany you, so that you remember our pact.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0607_0 -> Replace : Penitent One in silence, now resume your journey.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_0 -> Replace : What you seek lies at the end of these long stairs.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_1 -> Replace : That which proclaimed itself The True and Holy Truth has long been hiding there.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_2 -> Replace : Behind those doors, The Affliction itself laments in its own confusion and deformity.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_3 -> Replace : The journey has been long, but your task is about to be completed.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_4 -> Replace : Although I have been barred from entering such a slanderous abode, these words are free to accompany you.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_0 -> Replace : What you seek lies at the end of these long stairs.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_1 -> Replace : That which proclaimed itself The True and Holy Truth has long been hiding there.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_2 -> Replace : Behind those doors, The Affliction itself laments in its own confusion and deformity.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_3 -> Replace : The journey has been long, but your task is about to be completed.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_4 -> Replace : Although I have been barred from entering such a slanderous abode, these words are free to accompany you.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_0 -> Replace : What you seek lies at the end of these long stairs.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_1 -> Replace : That which proclaimed itself The True and Holy Truth has long been hiding there.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_2 -> Replace : Behind those doors, The Affliction itself laments in its own confusion and deformity.

ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_4 -> Replace : Although I have been barred from entering such a slanderous abode, these words are free to accompany you.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0609_A_0 -> Replace : Penitent One in silence, now resume your journey. I will guard you from afar.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0609_B_0 -> Replace : Penitent One in silence, now resume your journey. I will guard you from afar.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0609_C_0 -> Replace : Penitent One in silence, now resume your journey. I will guard you from afar.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_QT_0601_0 -> Replace : Penitent One in silence, will you require my assistance with your next task?
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_QT_0602_0 -> Replace : My protection does not cease here. Will you require my assistance with your next task? 
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_QT_0603_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, will you require my assistance with your next task?
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0701_0 -> Replace : Contrite and humiliated be the heart, Penitent One in silence. You stand before what remains of Gémino.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0701_1 -> Replace : Oh, do not fret for me. The cold is merciful, for it relieves our pain and numbs us before it leads us to our deaths.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0701_2 -> Replace : Perhaps the Miracle the others spoke of has come to me, here in this iron tomb, lengthening distress more and more...
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0701_3 -> Replace : To a promised land you direct your march, to the place where the frozen and the burning embrace in communion...
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0702_0 -> Replace : Now, let my numbed arm become another branch of this withered olive tree.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0702_1 -> Replace : Hurry up, I can still hear the call.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0703_0 -> Replace : I feel the boiling oil entering my frigid veins.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0703_1 -> Replace : I can still answer the call...
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0704_0 -> Replace : I feel the boiling oil entering my veins as it mixes with the frozen sap.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0704_1 -> Replace : I can no longer hear the others, only the crunch of my bones, of my skin...
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0705_0 -> Replace : Let me ask of you the favour of bringing me a few drops of the oils that once came out of these icy olive trees, the ones that ended up scorching the faces of every pious person who ever reached the summit.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0705_1 -> Replace : As my last wish, before it is too late for me, let me feel that pain.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0706_0 -> Replace : Take this.
ST07_GEMINO/MSG_0701_0 -> Replace : An item is needed to retrieve oil from the font.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0801_0 -> Replace : Sister of mine, as I foretold to you, someone is heading towards the forbidden gate.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0801_1 -> Replace : Someone who seeks the purge and excommunication of all that is sacred and rests there.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0801_2 -> Replace : No... No... Do not place your doubts on me.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0801_3 -> Replace : I am ready.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0802_0 -> Replace : Indeed, sister of mine. Our encounter is approaching.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0802_1 -> Replace : The Miracle will protect me. I do not need your protection this time.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0802_2 -> Replace : Leave me alone.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08201_0 -> Replace : That elusive light...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08201_1 -> Replace : It can't be her...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08201_2 -> Replace : Is that true, sister?
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08202_0 -> Replace : Virtuous Penitent One, this was the place where your sword was born of guilt itself, bringing pain to the flesh as the soul could suffer no more.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08202_1 -> Replace : The voice of my sister, may the glories protect her, recited verses to me as tender as they were wise, her words revealing a different destiny for you.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08202_2 -> Replace : Further away, although not in distance. Woven in shadows, though full of light.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08202_3 -> Replace : I have been guarding this key for a long time now.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08203_0 -> Replace : Is this really the sublime light of your virtue?
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08203_1 -> Replace : So...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08203_2 -> Replace : You have received the much esteemed and blessed favour of my sister.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08203_3 -> Replace : With her blessing she has given you the ability to hear her noble voice, full of grace.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08204_0 -> Replace : It will open the door behind which lies that which the holiness itself condemned to eternal reclusion.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08204_1 -> Replace : But I no longer have the power, nor the words, to describe it...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08204_2 -> Replace : Head for the Library of the Negated Words. There you'll find the keeper of keys, although the one I am entrusting you with is missing from his collection.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08205_0 -> Replace : Something has changed in her...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08205_1 -> Replace : Something unfathomable that escapes my judgement...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08206_0 -> Replace : Head for the Library of the Negated Words and look for the key bearer.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08207_0 -> Replace : The hands hewn in the gold of Crisanta's helmet eschew the glare of the truth that you must understand.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08207_1 -> Replace : Her faith will never let this light pass. Not even you believed in her.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08208_0 -> Replace : Penitent One. Meet me in the chapel where Guilt was given shape.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08208_1 -> Replace : Where you were anointed the Penitent One and where you knelt for the first time.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08208_2 -> Replace : It will be in this remote place that my sister will hear my plea, and will send her Voice to me once again.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0901_0 -> Replace : Oh... Behold, gracious lady. A visitor...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0901_1 -> Replace : Oh, please forgive me... Penitent One, you stand in the presence of Socorro, our Pious Lady of the Perpetual Agony.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0901_2 -> Replace : Isn't she majestic? She is a miracle in herself... Unceasing... Eternal...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0902_0 -> Replace : She suffers... For all of us... Day by day, with no rest, with no end...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0902_1 -> Replace : She is our living miracle, a true example of Holiness.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0903_0 -> Replace : What... What have you done? Our Lady...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0904_0 -> Replace : This...may be for the best... She had suffered enough...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0904_1 -> Replace : Is this...an act of true mercy?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0905_0 -> Replace : The Pain...runs free...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0906_0 -> Replace : The Pain is amongst us...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_0 -> Replace : I loved the Mercy incarnate in Her... and Her, the daughter of Mercy itself...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_1 -> Replace : How can I love the others more than holiness itself?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_2 -> Replace : The order... I remember it. Its Rule was my Rule some time ago...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_3 -> Replace : My thoughts are forlorn, Penitent One...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_4 -> Replace : I need to...pray.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0908_0 -> Replace : I have held vigil by her side for years.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0908_1 -> Replace : I have borne witness to each and every one of her sufferings, her lamentations, and her wounds... Which would heal only to bleed again, in an endless ordeal.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0909_0 -> Replace : Three penitents that communed with the Miracle clamoured for her refuge and protection.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0909_1 -> Replace : Those souls she suffered for have already departed to the other side of The Dream.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0910_0 -> Replace : Penitent One in charity, this is my new home and from here shall my vigil begin anew.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0910_1 -> Replace : Take these words I managed to transcribe from the voice of Our Lady amidst suffering, so they can become a prayer which you can raise in her memory.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0911_0 -> Replace : The Order blesses you, Penitent One in the righteous path.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0912_0 -> Replace : A tear has rolled off her cheek... Could it be that her torment has diminished?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0912_1 -> Replace : Our poor Lady...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_0 -> Replace : The Lady...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_1 -> Replace : Three penitents that communed with the Miracle clamoured for her refuge and protection.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_2 -> Replace : Those souls for which she suffered have already departed to the other side of The Dream.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_3 -> Replace : Has the Holy Commandment of my Lady finished...? 
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_4 -> Replace : Penitent One... Whom shall I watch over now?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0914_0 -> Replace : Now she shall lament no more.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0915_0 -> Replace : Thank you, Penitent One in silence. It is my duty to watch over the others in the absence of Our Lady. The Order awaits me. 
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0916_0 -> Replace : I need to pray.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0917_0 -> Replace : Now she will not be able to shield the rest from the anguish of the blood.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0917_1 -> Replace : The same Affliction that in the past bestowed her with such sorrowful and miraculous favour has given birth to a new, terrible outbreak.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0917_2 -> Replace : Is this the punishment for so many years of holiness?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_QT_0904_ANSWER_0 -> Replace : Make an offering
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_QT_0904_ANSWER_1 -> Replace : End her suffering
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10101_0 -> Replace : Two faces greet you, Penitent One. My name is Nacimiento.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10101_1 -> Replace : Look at my chest, upon which an ancient visage grows older and older. A face that does not speak, that does not think, while mine becomes younger such that I now look like a child.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10101_2 -> Replace : Such a terrible sentence is this that I do not understand its purpose; no matter how much I reflect on the sins that I may have committed to deserve it.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10101_3 -> Replace : The grace of the Miracle is present even in those who are punished. Perhaps I might reduce the magnitude of this sentence by helping you.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10102_0 -> Replace : Bring me the quicksilver, which is capable of flourishing under our feet in any place at the whim of the Grievous One, and I will mix it with the bile from your flasks, thereby enhancing its gift.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10103_0 -> Replace : Graceful be the heart.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10104_0 -> Replace : With this silver, I bless the mixture that will recover your spilled blood.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10105_0 -> Replace : I feel tired... Please, leave me alone.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10106_0 -> Replace : The ancient one... is exiting my body... It is being born through the rift in my chest, from which its visage was peering.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10106_1 -> Replace : Penitent One... What must I do? Must I allow the Miracle to continue with its punishment?
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10106_2 -> Replace : Hurry. Bring me the quicksilver before it is too late.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10107_0 -> Replace : With this quicksilver, I bless the mixture... That will recover your spilled blood.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10108_0 -> Replace : Hurry... Bring me the quicksilver before it is too late....
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10109_0 -> Replace : For your own sake, leave me alone... There is no need to think about what is about to happen...
ST101_NACIMIENTO/MSG_10101_0 -> Replace : The healing power of the Bile Flasks has been improved.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_0 -> Replace : The light... The light that you bring blinds my eyes...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_1 -> Replace : I am called Jibrael, held captive by the Ancient Miracle's plans since my arms grew, since the first creak of my crooked neck.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_2 -> Replace : The Miracle named me the messenger of the Saeta. Yes... The Saeta is the song, the genuine, pure melody... And very, very old...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_3 -> Replace : It has the power to make the roots of the Miracle unearth the hidden depths, what has already been forgotten, where the truly forbidden sleeps, that which awaits you...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_4 -> Replace : But we find ourselves in a mere abandoned chamber. After our encounter, the Miracle will take me where the Saeta will be able to resonate in all its grace.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10202_0 -> Replace : One Amanecida has already awoken, which is why the Saeta is already resounding.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10203_0 -> Replace : The same Grievous Will that allows you to see my bent and warped body is what has allowed you to enter the Gallery of the Five Dawns.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10203_1 -> Replace : This is where the sealed Mirror Sarcophagus is found, within which rests the body of Laudes, first of the Amanecidas. It was her very flesh that gave birth to the other four.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10203_2 -> Replace : No... A profane, distorted visage such as mine would never be reflected in such a holy casket, but yours would, still concealed behind the iron anonymity.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10203_3 -> Replace : Laudes waits. Though her body slumbers, her mind does not. She will open her eyes when the other four Amanecidas close theirs forever.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10204_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, the moment has arrived. It is your choice that I sound this bugle that weighs down my arms and twists my spine.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10204_1 -> Replace : It is your choice that its bronze exhumes the crystal tombs where the Amanecidas await you.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10205_0 -> Replace : You have prevailed in your first clash. The first Amanecida has closed her eyes and now rests elsewhere.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10206_0 -> Replace : The Amanecidas of the Miracle await you...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10207_0 -> Replace : Oh... I can wait...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10207_1 -> Replace : Yes... A little more...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10208_0 -> Replace : The time of the opening of the Mirror Sarcophagus draws near.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10209_0 -> Replace : The Miracle was jealous... Yes... It was jealous of that unmeasured passion towards the Twisted One of Laudes, and of her four replicas, her four reflections. It wanted all of that devotion for itself.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10209_1 -> Replace : Thus it took the Amanecidas and buried them deep in glass sarcophagi that contained all of that excessive fervour. It condemned them to wait until The Miracle reclaimed them freely.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10210_0 -> Replace : Laudes... Oh, my Laudes....
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10210_1 -> Replace : Have you been set free? Are you returning to the other side of the dream now that you have served your sentence?
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10210_2 -> Replace : Tell me that I will be at your side... Tell me that... all of this waiting... has not been in vain.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10211_0 -> Replace : The Amanecidas of the Miracle await you. Until then, Penitent One.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10213_0 -> Replace : Great happiness awaits me...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10214_0 -> Replace : The Ancient Miracle never forgot the Five... It bound them by its holy whim, it cursed them, it condemned them. Yes... It has kept them asleep in case it needed them. And now it needs them.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_QT_10201_0 -> Replace : Do you want to make the bronze sing?
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1002_0 -> Replace : Let us be captives of the Miracle, Penitent One.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1003_0 -> Replace : Behold what I present to you; though a small piece, its great power should not be underestimated.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1003_1 -> Replace : Trust me, for I have the blood of kings on the palm of my hand.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1004_0 -> Replace : What I am offering you here is as lustrous as the first star of the night.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1004_1 -> Replace : And may my eyes be blinded if I am lying.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1005_0 -> Replace : This is a precious treasure to me... Its value goes far beyond what I ask for it.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1005_1 -> Replace : And may I don mourning black if I am trying to deceive you.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1006_0 -> Replace : Handing this over is not something that delights me, so its price is as high as its value to me.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1007_0 -> Replace : Feast your eyes on the envy of every merchant. The finest treasure to ever find its way into my hands.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1007_1 -> Replace : And may my heart stop beating if I am being dishonest.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1010_0 -> Replace : Do not be surprised to find this merchant here, this ancient occupation requires me to be wherever I can obtain rewarding benefits.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1010_1 -> Replace : Call me Candelaria, for what I sell would make your eyes light up like the high bonfires.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1010_2 -> Replace : I will not ask you for any money whatsoever; those forbidden tears you shed would be more than enough for me.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1010_3 -> Replace : Go ahead, cast your darkened eyes over these valuable treasures.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1012_0 -> Replace : Come back when you have more Tears of Atonement.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1013_0 -> Replace : And may the bells toll for me if I ever deceive you.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1014_0 -> Replace : And may the bells toll for me if I ever deceive you.
ST10_CANDELARIA/MSG_1001_0 -> Replace : The key has been broken.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_1101_0 -> Replace : The sound does not cease.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_1101_1 -> Replace : It creeps on these forgotten walls, and no one can determine its origin or its obscure destiny.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_1101_2 -> Replace : For the love of the the High Wills, silence it, for I have long yearned for it.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_1106_0 -> Replace : For the love of the High Wills, make the sound cease.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11201_0 -> Replace : I, Diosdado by name, night watchman by trade, am at thy mercy.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11201_1 -> Replace : You have my gratitude for quelling such an unbearable sound.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11201_2 -> Replace : We are in the Library of the Denied Words, for the pages that lie within these dusty tomes are forbidden and forever shall be.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11201_3 -> Replace : All that accompanies me here are these ponderous keys and the wandering souls that, even after death, still hunger for knowledge.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11202_0 -> Replace : Watch your step as these halls can be deceptive.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11203_0 -> Replace : Oh, that key of yours that you are carrying...
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11203_1 -> Replace : It opens a door that was veiled in ancient illusions many aeons ago.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11204_0 -> Replace : Beware of what sleeps there.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11205_0 -> Replace : The door awaits thee.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11205_1 -> Replace : Be careful of what sleeps beyond.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11206_0 -> Replace : The Visage...
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11206_1 -> Replace : At times, during the most profound silences, you can hear the gold melting within the rock, within the very roots.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11207_0 -> Replace : Watch your step, as these rooms can be deceptive.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_0 -> Replace : Penitent One in sleeplessness.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_1 -> Replace : Carrying the guilty sword, you have committed the most serious crimes against the Mother and her Saints, against the Miracle and its outbreaks.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_2 -> Replace : We have been entrusted with putting an end to your mission.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_3 -> Replace : I, Crisanta in penance, excommunicate you, expel you, execrate you, with the blessing of Our Miracle of the Greatest Pain.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_4 -> Replace : And thus shall your name be erased under the heavens.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1202_0 -> Replace : Go on... Purge my soul, bitten by The Miracle.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1208_0 -> Replace : And thus...shall your name be erased under the heavens...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_0 -> Replace : Once again... My mask of blindness meets your silent one.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_1 -> Replace : Do not worry on my account... The crimson cords protect me from being wounded...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_2 -> Replace : It is true, and so...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_3 -> Replace : Your sword and you - Guilt and Penance in holy communion - only you both can put an end to this eternal cycle. To this eternal twilight with neither beginning nor end.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_4 -> Replace : Penitent One, there is something greater than the Mother Church, greater than the Miracle, greater than what I have protected with my life and my faith...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_5 -> Replace : It is that which controls the Miracle...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_6 -> Replace : I am speaking of the Supreme Trinity... The High Wills.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_7 -> Replace : They can be found on the other side of the Dream, on the path of the Eternal Processions.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_8 -> Replace : But only a soul in Supreme Suffering can obtain Supreme Absolution, and thus be able to reach such a place.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12202_0 -> Replace : Now you are marked by the Four Wounds. The final ascension awaits beyond the Throne. Beyond the Dream.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12202_1 -> Replace : Perform your final penance and make your way to the Turned Throne.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12202_2 -> Replace : The Eternal Processions await us on the other side.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_0 -> Replace : This pain... that I feel...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_1 -> Replace : It is... deeper... more ancient...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_2 -> Replace : The Guilt you carry... has broken something inside of me...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_3 -> Replace : My faith... My soul... is wounded...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_4 -> Replace : I will now walk to the chapel where it all began, where the first Kneeling took place.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_5 -> Replace : Your first step... towards atonement.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_6 -> Replace : Now leave me alone with my deep wound.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_0 -> Replace : The severed crimson bindings now reveal my agony.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_1 -> Replace : They are uneasy to see you, the architect of sacrilege, here at the end of this bitter, sombre and desolate path...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_2 -> Replace : His Holiness, our father, awaits you under the marble of his white deambulatory.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_3 -> Replace : He will achieve that which my bandaged sword could not. He will leave you on your knees in the ashes of the holy tree that once burned.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_4 -> Replace : He will lay his merciful hand on your forehead sanctifying the end of your blasphemy.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12205_0 -> Replace : Leave me alone with these lies, with the chimera, with the delirium of my own pain.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12206_0 -> Replace : That sword you wield...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12206_1 -> Replace : The High Wills sing that I must escape the kiss of its steel, as it is wholly tainted by the heresy of its bearer.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12206_2 -> Replace : The Great Ones, from the Eternal Processions, demand that I should battle until I draw my dying breath.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12206_3 -> Replace : The Three...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12207_0 -> Replace : The High Voices proclaim that your execution cannot be delayed.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12207_1 -> Replace : And so I fear... that my penance is far from over.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12208_0 -> Replace : Not while their voices still echo... Not while your silence endures...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12209_0 -> Replace : The guardian has fallen.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12209_1 -> Replace : The final truth awaits you. The final outrage.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12209_2 -> Replace : Go forward now through the embroidered mantles towards the light.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12210_0 -> Replace : Behind me, Penitent One.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12210_1 -> Replace : Take cover in my crimson bindings.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1401_0 -> Replace : The Deformity has opened up.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1401_1 -> Replace : You have been granted three knotted tongues, able to grow deep roots that will twist and wring, copying the pain of their three mothers.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1401_2 -> Replace : In the name of the High Wills, I bless this relic. Watch over it, for it is now pure and sacred.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1403_0 -> Replace : At the time of its death, before the journey, the Miracle kissed the hand of the master, stopping the corruption of the flesh and granting him a new grace.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1403_1 -> Replace : In the name of the High Wills, I bless this relic. Watch over it, for it is now pure and sacred.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1404_0 -> Replace : Behold the linen cloth that soaks the sweat of fevers, of thoughts, of dreamt sins.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1404_1 -> Replace : A tool that obtains secret and forbidden confessions, even from those who already departed to the other side of the Dream.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1404_2 -> Replace : In the name of the High Wills, I bless this relic. Watch over it, for it is now pure and sacred.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1406_0 -> Replace : This place is another dream, Penitent One.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1406_1 -> Replace : They believed me a saint worthy of devotions, and the only thing I granted to their prayers was the saltpetre that runs through this stark land and rises through our bodies. 
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1406_2 -> Replace : The punishment of the Miracle for the false idol is to grant them false holiness.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1406_3 -> Replace : Do not try to obtain my name, for it is also covered in salt.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1410_0 -> Replace : Bring me anything that can be blessed, so you might crush this fate of mine and let me cross to the other side of this false dream.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1501_0 -> Replace : Penitent One without a name, find my brothers and guide them to me.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1502_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, in finding these holy brethren of mine you have completed the vision of my birth, which was painted on a sleeping canvas.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1502_1 -> Replace : My name being Jocinero, I was born of the moon and of the torment of a brave bull, and of myself, by the grace of High Wills, my holy brethren.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1503_0 -> Replace : Joyful are your returning steps. You have found all of my brothers imprisoned by the Miracle.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1503_1 -> Replace : Now that they are free they will be able to protect all souls in penance, as well as your own.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1503_2 -> Replace : Come closer, and take this piece of moon. With it, one of my holy brethren will join you whenever necessary.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1504_0 -> Replace : Contrite be the heart, Penitent One in good fortune.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1506_0 -> Replace : You have found some of my brothers.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1506_1 -> Replace : Though I still ask you to find the rest of them, please keep this canvas made from the gold of our faces, and the Brothers will guide you.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1507_0 -> Replace : Please find the rest.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1701_0 -> Replace : With this gold that melts between my fingers, I reject the riches of my betrothed. 
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1702_0 -> Replace : With this torn ribbon I reject this bond with my betrothed.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1703_0 -> Replace : With this veil I cover my face in mourning for the dead love for my betrothed.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1704_0 -> Replace : Penitent One in silence, who summons my three voices.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1704_1 -> Replace : Three sisters became as one, thus birthing a Grievous Miracle called Altasgracias.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1704_2 -> Replace : This egg conceals something of ours that still remains immaculate.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1705_0 -> Replace : Take it with you, and thus take its purity away from us, for it is already too late for these deformed bodies.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1706_0 -> Replace : Our rageful voices were banished then. Now the Miracle has made them eternal.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1706_1 -> Replace : Remember that only the Holiness can bless this gift so that it is without sin.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1706_2 -> Replace : Our voices can be protection on the pathways along which your fortunate steps will take you.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1707_0 -> Replace : Leave now. Our deformities will depart to the other side of The Dream to find absolution.
ST18_NAZARIO/MSG_1801_0 -> Replace : The Virtue of Mea Culpa hath ascended.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_0 -> Replace : This lowly servant greets you, oh Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_1 -> Replace : Welcome to the ossuary of all those who will be eternally remembered.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_2 -> Replace : My duty is none other than to provide shelter to each and every one of these skeletal remains that linger under these intangible veils of dust.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_3 -> Replace : It matters little how many years or centuries have passed; the bones speak to us, through their creaking and grinding and through their silence.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_4 -> Replace : But these remains need one another in order to reveal the truth they still guard within.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_5 -> Replace : Only together, in intimate brotherhood, will they achieve eternal rest. For this, they beg that you help them.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_6 -> Replace : Bring them before me and in this way we will uncover the truth that they have silenced.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20102_0 -> Replace : Listen to the creaking of the bones in the darkness; for they hear us too.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20102_1 -> Replace : The bones are grateful for your help. They are awakening and with them, so too is the Voice.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20103_0 -> Replace : This great ossuary is filling up. The ashes flow ever more from the urns...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20104_0 -> Replace : The pale brotherhood of the bones is about to be completed.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20104_1 -> Replace : Do not falter now, Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_0 -> Replace : Oh... The ossuary is now complete.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_1 -> Replace : So, my mission here has ended.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_2 -> Replace : No... I will no longer watch over the bones...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_3 -> Replace : It is they who will now watch over me in this tomb of pale and merciful ash.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_4 -> Replace : May their peace be with you, Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20106_0 -> Replace : Bring the rest of the bones before me, Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20107_0 -> Replace : Can you already hear their song? Can you already hear their ancient aria?
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20107_1 -> Replace : The lady who sang to the bones has awoken...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20107_2 -> Replace : The skeletal remains on the other side have opened the door to you. They bid you welcome.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20107_3 -> Replace : But beware of the secret they wish to share.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, you have finished with the suffering of the Singer.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_1 -> Replace : Her song was formed by the very voices of all the souls resting in this place;
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_2 -> Replace : their stories, tragedies and sorrows flowed through her voice creating melodious echoes.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_3 -> Replace : Creating a psalm of shadows.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_4 -> Replace : The voice of the dead, Isidora...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20109_0 -> Replace : Look... see how the ash rises up beneath our feet.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20109_1 -> Replace : From the other side of the door, the bones long for the Voice to awaken and sing to us once more.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20109_2 -> Replace : Oh... her sweet Voice...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20110_0 -> Replace : Bring the bones before me and we will uncover the truth that they keep silent.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20111_0 -> Replace : The bones thank you for your help, oh virtuous Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20112_0 -> Replace : The bones thank you for your help, oh virtuous Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20112_1 -> Replace : Bring the bones before me and we will uncover the truth that they keep silent.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20201_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, you stand before the tomb below which my name, Perpetva, rests. And with it, a body vanquished a long time ago.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20201_1 -> Replace : Although we were already introduced through the wounds of our confrontation, the audacity of your faith now gives us the chance to meet once again.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20201_2 -> Replace : A meeting behind the back of a Miracle that ends up knowing all.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20202_0 -> Replace : You fell before a deception, created by the Miraculous Zeal, that possessed my face and armour but not my voice, which is now free from sin and dominion.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20202_1 -> Replace : But I could see that your will is greater than any pain in your body and in your deaths, and that they will not hold you back in the journey ahead.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20203_0 -> Replace : You were able to defeat the lie created by the Miraculous Zeal that possessed my face and armour but not my voice, which is now free of sin and dominion.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20203_1 -> Replace : However, I see in you that the guilt that weighs so heavily in both your heart and hands is deserving of such arduous penance.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_0 -> Replace : Such is your strength that my brother Esdras, convinced that you will commit crimes against the Church, has asked for my blessing to prevent you accessing such a sacred place.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_1 -> Replace : Penitent One, I have seen a different path for you, whose ultimate destination is neither the forbidden nor the sacred places kept behind the high walls of Mother Church.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_2 -> Replace : Rise above all that, above even the halls of the Dream.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_3 -> Replace : This voice of mine is limited, it cannot disperse all the invisible mists that tangle up the truth and mislead us.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_4 -> Replace : You must meet with my brother. He will be waiting for you on the bridge that leads to the Door of the Holy Visages.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_5 -> Replace : Take this scapular, whose sheen will tell him you have my blessing, and before which he will surely fall to his knees. As he loves me, deeply.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_6 -> Replace : At that moment, my soft whisper will reach his ears, beseeching him to assist you.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_0 -> Replace : Penitent One, you have defeated my brother and now he is in a faraway place where my voice does not reach.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_1 -> Replace : I cannot ask him to help you unravel these shadows that keep weaving themselves before us, for they protect a truth that is now lost to us.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_2 -> Replace : Like you, the Miracle perpetuates its obscurity.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_3 -> Replace : Leave me now to watch over my brother even if seas, skies and red horizons separate us.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_4 -> Replace : Go, Penitent One.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20206_0 -> Replace : Go fearlessly, Penitent One.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20207_0 -> Replace : The wounds of our first confrontation healed long ago.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20207_1 -> Replace : Even then I could see how unyielding you were in your purpose and that nothing would cause you to waver.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_0 -> Replace : Penitent One of the silent steps.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_10 -> Replace : Find my eyes, Penitent One. For only then will I be able to reveal my secret to you.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_1 -> Replace : Approach this face of pale gold, with empty sockets instead of eyes.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_2 -> Replace : You stand before the roots of the knotted tree of the Three Words, for these form the bars of my captivity.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_3 -> Replace : They claim that my words are false and that mine is the face of deception...
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_4 -> Replace : And for this reason, I have been exiled from my three other brothers, the Holy Guardian Visages.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_5 -> Replace : They betrayed me, punished me and ripped out my eyes, so I could no longer be a witness to the truth.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_6 -> Replace : Now there is only infinite darkness around me.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_7 -> Replace : May your compassion help you in the search for my stolen, golden eyes.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_8 -> Replace : One of them can be found in a place inhabited by bone, ash and song.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_9 -> Replace : The other can be found in a dried-up sea, to which ships head to die amidst the terrible thunder.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20302_0 -> Replace : Oh... Even in this place, beneath so many floors, I am bedazzled.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20302_1 -> Replace : But blessed be the light whose intensity blinds, for behind it lies always a seed of virtue.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20302_2 -> Replace : Find my other eye, oh merciful Penitent One.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_0 -> Replace : You have found my eyes...
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_1 -> Replace : Now I can see this terrible place, this prison of what I am and have been for so very long...
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_2 -> Replace : Penitent One, listen carefully.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_3 -> Replace : In the most fervent souls, in the most devout hearts lives the seed that lulls the consciousness and controls the will
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_4 -> Replace : They are the links of invisible chains that hail from remote, sacred and forbidden places.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_5 -> Replace : From where the High Wills dwell.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_6 -> Replace : I am going to give you that which I have been protecting since I was banished from the Dream.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_7 -> Replace : Here, take it. This is the True Heart of your guilty blade.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20305_0 -> Replace : May your compassion help you find my stolen eyes.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20305_1 -> Replace : For only then will I be able to reveal my secret to you.

ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2001_0 -> Replace : I have witnessed the exhumation of the Archbishop. I have witnessed how they cleansed his bones in wine to then dress him in silk and gold.

They lifted him up, calling his name, and swayed him to make it look as if he was walking again.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2002_0 -> Replace : I can feel Our Lady between these walls. I can feel her warmth, for her face still burns, a reminder of her sacrifice and ours. The pain, the cold and the burn are our Rules.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2003_0 -> Replace : I am fearful. The little one stopped crying as soon as we placed him in the arms of that wicker woman, as if it were his mother. Sometimes I can't help but think there's something living in that wicker. Sometimes it seems to be rocking him in the darkness.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2004_0 -> Replace : Indeed, it is the Groan. It comes from the deepest core of this place, slithering in spirals, growing with its own echo, distorting amidst the bronze embossings.

ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2005_0 -> Replace : I saw him approaching between the bars. I saw fire burst through his chest and scorch him. I saw fire burn again from thin air, and fuse his skin. He walks with fire, and fire with him.

ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2008_0 -> Replace : What are those little ones that seem to hide up in the ceilings, amongst the ornaments of the altars? When I call them, they do not appear to pay me any mind.

What are you, oh creatures of divine grace!?
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2009_0 -> Replace : I hear them reading. They mutter the forbidden writings. It is a constant murmuring whose echoes, once inside my mind, refuse to leave. I know that my curiosity will kill me, if my madness does not do it first.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2010_0 -> Replace : It is closer now. The crying faces of ice announce the proximity of the convent. They presage the pain awaiting inside its walls. I ask the cold to be merciful and allow me to climb to the peaks, where I will be reborn as a sister of golden visage.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2011_0 -> Replace : On this sacred floor I will be safe. They will hear neither my footsteps nor my fear. The Miracle wanted the oranges from those trees to make no sound on falling, so that only the wind through the columns and buttresses could be heard... Now I hear only the horrific screams of those punished by the Miracle. I will wait patiently.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2012_0 -> Replace : How many more prayers does the Great Censer want? When will it tire and stop swaying? When will we be able to stand again? Lower your head... Close your eyes... Pray... And do not get up.

ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2026_0 -> Replace : Everyone passes...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2027_0 -> Replace : Beneath the earth the paths are misleading. This is the lie that haunts these tunnels. The howl of the wind and the roar of the waves can be heard and yet, there is no wind or sea... Not even the blue flame atop the masts burns our hands...

ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2030_0 -> Replace : The doors are deceiving me, they do not want me to go. The walls are the only ones that do not lie. Through the walls lies the way out of this place...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2031_0 -> Replace : The waters are tranquil and dark like the blackest of marble. My face is reflected in them as in a mirror of darkness, which prevents me from escaping its gaze...

Sword/HE03_CAPTION -> Replace : Heart of Saltpeter Blood
Sword/HE03_DESCRIPTION -> Replace : Attack damage is increased when The Penitent One is close to death.
Sword/HE03_LORE -> Replace : It wasn't long before he was beatified. The Miracle bestowed a gift upon that humble parish priest and confessor the visions of all sin, future and past, of thought and deed, of every person who approached him. He did not need to hear our confessions, because he already knew them all. He knew the penance, he knew the sincerity of our repentance. He knew everything. There was no more intimacy between sins and sinners; we were all naked before him, and the Miracle. Such grace came to be feared.

Sword/HE101_LORE -> Replace : The mere thought of you tires my body; the vision of you fills my eyes with tears. What do you provoke in me, holy stranger? It is your sacrifice that guides all the love I profess to you. @My sin is to love, to love holiness, the sacredness that resides in you and in what you represent, which is in turn blessed and forbidden. This love weighs more and more heavily within me, and asks me to leave the confines of my breast. I can no longer hold it back, for it has a will of its own. Let my skin open.

Sword/HE201_LORE -> Replace : Four was the number of the Father's greatest devotees. Four who witnessed the first miracle.
